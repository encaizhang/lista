Lista
======

_This is my linked list. There are many like it, but this one is mine._

#### Usage
_More coming here soon_

#### About
I keep finding myself reaching for a linked list structure on various occasions and either have to roll my own or import some large (and usually brilliant) package of multiple algorithms and storage types. I just want a tiny and fast linked list with no dependencies, so I ended up writing this one, and since I ended up using it in various places, I've made it available here for others to use/copy/tweak/improve.

For public projects, I've used it in [Trailer](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/trailer), [Trailer-CLI](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/trailer-cli) and [trailer-ql](https://github.com/ptsochantaris/trailer-cli)
